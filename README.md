This work was carried out in the context of the dissertation "Automated approaches for the selection of the ARMA model order".

This repository is organized into three different folders.

- Dissertation code: All the code used for the dissertation.
- Freitas-Gouveia - Python: Python .ipynb with a function that, given a time series, returns the optimal ARMA model order via the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm, the improved version of it, and a novel approach based on LSTMs.
- Freitas-Gouveia - R: R script that, given a time series, returns the optimal ARMA model order via the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm, the improved version of it, and a novel approach based on LSTMs.
